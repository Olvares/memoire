ABSTRACT = {Spodoptera frugiperda was first reported in Africa in 2016 and has since become a serious threat to maize/cereal production on the continent. Current control of the pest relies on synthetic chemical insecticides, which can negatively impact the environment and promote the development of resistance when used indiscriminately. Therefore, great attention is being paid to the development of safer alternatives. In this study, several biorational products and a semi-synthetic insecticide were evaluated. Two household soaps (&ldquo;Palmida&rdquo; and &ldquo;Koto&rdquo;) and a detergent (&ldquo;So Klin&rdquo;) were first tested for their efficacy against the larvae under laboratory conditions. Then, the efficacy of the most effective soap was evaluated in field conditions, along with PlantNeem (neem oil), Dezone (diatomaceous earth), and Emacot 19 EC (emamectin benzoate), in two districts, N&rsquo;Dali and Adjohoun, located, respectively, in northern and southern Benin. The soaps and the detergent were highly toxic t second-instar larvae with 24 h lethal concentrations (LC50) of 0.46%, 0.44%, and 0.37% for So Klin, Koto, and Palmida, respectively. In field conditions, the biorational insecticides produced similar or better control than Emacot 19 EC. However, the highest maize grain yields of 7387 and 5308 kg/ha were recorded, respectively, with Dezone (N&rsquo;Dali) and Emacot 19 EC (Adjohoun). A cost-benefit analysis showed that, compared to an untreated control, profits increased by up to 90% with the biorational insecticides and 166% with Emacot 19 EC. Therefore, the use of Palmida soap at 0.5% concentration, neem oil at 4.5 L/ha, and Dezone at 7.5 kg/ha could provide an effective, environmentally friendly, and sustainable management of S. frugiperda in maize.},
